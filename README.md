# Material Design 3 for React with @lit/react

Welcome to the repository for integrating Material Design 3 into React using the @lit/react package. This project is built using the Next.js framework and serves as a bridge to use Material Design 3 in React applications.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to use Material Design 3 web components in a React project. The components are sourced from the `@material/web` package, which is the web implementation of Material Design 3. Since there's no native support for React yet, this project aims to fill that gap.

### Project Structure

- The project follows a standard NextJs project, including the use of a `src` directory. This directory hosts all the code, while the `root` directory hosts all configurations.

- The core code that translates Material Design 3 to React can be found in the `src/components/material` directory.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Gryt-chat/material-gryt-3.git
    cd material-gryt-3
    ```

2. Install the dependencies using Yarn:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3. Run the development server:
    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

You can explore the components in the `src/components/material` directory to see how Material Design 3 is being translated to React. Example usage can be found in the `page.tsx` files. Feel free to use and modify these components in your own projects.
